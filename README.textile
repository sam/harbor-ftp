h1. Setup

All necessary Java jar dependencies are included. Just bundle your Ruby dependencies from the Gemfile.

Then just start it up (I'm using RVM to run JRuby-HEAD under OpenJDK 7u2 on OSX):

bc. bin/harbor-ftp

h2. TODO

* Implement our own simple UserManager (see: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/mina/ftpserver/trunk/ftplet-api/src/main/java/org/apache/ftpserver/ftplet/UserManager.java?view=markup)
* Create a much simpler facade in Ruby to configure and start server
  * Tests
* Provide base Ruby implementations as reference for common tasks like integrating with your own user authentication system, or overriding the LIST command, etc
